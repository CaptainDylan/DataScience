Description of project scripts

Getting and Cleaning Data course project

September 2014

The script run_analysis.R performs all the data processing.

The script first reads in all the data files.  Then it combines the test and training data.  Next it loops through all the field names and adds only the required fields/columns to the final data frame.  Next it appends the activity name to the end of the data frame.  Finally it writes the output file.

The CodeBook.md file describes the variable names, data sets, and how they are related.
